# OSIS Coverdale project

Transcriptions were missing the Apocrypha and certain typographical marks, some less important than others.

Scan to compare against: http://bibles-online.net/1535/

Alternative (but incomplete) transcription of the New Testament: https://holyscriptures.com/luke-chapter-1/
This one preserves macrons among other things. Should find some way to scrape and compare it.

## Restoring shortened words
* ye → yͤ
* yt → yͭ
* yi → yͥ
* yt → yͭ
* wt → wͭ

### Macrons

"ē" was used in the Coverdale bible to shortened "en". The macron on the e was omitted in transcription. The text should be scoured for all shortened words. Below I list the ones I have corrected already:

* heaue → heauē
* firmamet → firmamēt
* childre → childrē
* cotynue → cōtynue
* cotinueth → cōtinueth
* fro → frō
* Abraha*s* → Abrahā*s*
* Absolo → Absolō
* excellet → excellēt
* ma → mā

## Omitted Text
The «(Omitted Text)» were part of the transcription. I assume these are the result of a small difference in versification. Will double-check with the scan if I have some free time.
