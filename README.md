# OSIS Coverdale project

Transcriptions were missing the Apocrypha and certain typographical marks, some less important than others.

Scan to compare against: http://bibles-online.net/1535/

## Restoring shortened words
* ye -> yͤ
* yt -> yͭ

### Macrons

"ē" was used in the Coverdale bible to shortened "en". The macron on the e was omitted in transcription. The text should be scoured for all shortened words. Below I list the ones I have corrected already:

* heaue -> heauē
* firmamet -> firmamēt
* childre -> childrē

### Omitted Text
The «(Omitted Text)» were part of the transcription. I assume these are the result of a small difference in versification. Will double-check with the scan if I have some free time.
